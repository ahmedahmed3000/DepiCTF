Top CTF-Style Practice Labs
1. TryHackMe: "Wormhole" (Recommended for Web App & Linux PrivEsc)
This is a good, free TryHackMe machine that touches on several of your key areas and is often solvable in 1-3 hours for a team.

Focus Areas Covered: Authentication (default credentials), Command Injection (often for initial access), Recon (finding the vuln), and Privilege Escalation (Linux).

Why it's good for a team: It has a clear path and requires a mix of web-app testing and Linux enumeration skills, allowing your team to split the work.

Access: Requires a free TryHackMe account. Once logged in, search for the room "Wormhole."

2. TryHackMe: "Bounty Hunter" (Recommended for Web/File Upload)
If you want to focus heavily on a web vulnerability like file upload, this is a great free option.

Focus Areas Covered: Recon (vulnerability discovery), File Upload (exploitation), Command Injection (often used in the payload).

Access: Requires a free TryHackMe account. Search for the room "Bounty Hunter."

3. Hack The Box: Free Tier "Starting Point" or "Tier 0" Machines
Hack The Box has a rotating set of free machines that are excellent practice. Look for the "Starting Point" or "Tier 0" machines, which are designed to be easier and quicker to solve.

Focus Areas Covered: These machines are full penetration tests that generally cover Recon, an initial Web App vulnerability (like injection, auth, or file upload), and Linux Privilege Escalation.

Team Tip: Check the machine's community-driven "difficulty" rating to ensure it's solvable in your 3-hour window. Look for "Very Easy" or "Easy" boxes.

Strategy for Your 3-Hour Team Session
Since a single machine won't hit "Networks" and the others equally, I suggest a time-boxed approach:

Time	Activity	Focus Area(s)
0 - 30 mins	Initial Recon & Enumeration	Recon, Networks (port scanning, service versioning)
30 - 90 mins	Web Application Exploitation	Authentication/Authorization (testing login/roles), Command Injection, File Upload (testing all web forms/inputs)
90 - 180 mins	Post-Exploitation & Lateral Movement	Privilege Escalation (Linux) (enumeration, kernel exploits, misconfigurations)
